# About the project

The Black Slave Revolts project aims to create an interactive digital map of slave revolts by Africans and African descendants from 1500â€“1922, both on land and in water, for use of general educators, students, and other researchers. Each map point provides information through text descriptions, images, videos, audio recordings, and other resources for further learning.
