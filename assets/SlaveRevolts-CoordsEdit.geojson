Most whites fled the island, in particular those who were warned by their loyal Blacks. (Image 4) The Dutch illicited the support of the British colonies from Tortola and St. Kitts to quell the revolt but they were unsuccessful-it was the role of the Free Negro Corps infantry in combination with the French that led to their defeat.  In the end over 48 plantations out of 92 were destroyed-87 Blacks and 29 whites were killed.  The leader was asked to surrender and a deal would ensue; however, as soon as he did he was murdered.  Other rebels committed suicide rather than to face capture. (Image 5 & ^) Lori Lee in Encyclopedia of Slave Resistance and Rebellion, Junius Rodriguez ,eds. Greenwood Press: 2006, pp. 435-437.",
